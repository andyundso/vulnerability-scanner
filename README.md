# Vulnerability scanner

(I'm writing this README five years later after I created the application, so not everything will documented as good as it could be).

Back when I did my apprenticeship, there was one course in school about security and we had to come up with a project that was related to security. As I was just learning Rails at that time, I decided to build a project that can check a given list of software and their versions against a list of vulnerabilties.

Here's how it roughly worked:

* Every night, an import job gets a list of vulnerabilities from the NVD. It breaks those information up into software that are linked to versions and vulnerabilities that are linked to versions.
* You were able to sign up and download a Powershell script to your computer. This script indexed the computer for software and uploaded the list to the Rails application.
* Upon receiving a software list, the application saved it and checked the versions against the known vulnerabilities.
* The user was able to review which versions were vulnerable.

I remember that it only worked half-way. Given the Git history, I coded most things late in the night, so that could be an explanation. But it was one of the first Rails project I coded all on my own, for that it's alright.
